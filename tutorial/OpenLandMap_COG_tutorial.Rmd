## OpenLandMap on Wasabi / Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF

Part of: [OpenLandMap global layers](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers)  
Last update:  `r Sys.Date()`

[Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/) are post-processed images that are optimized for file sharing and can be considered to be equivalent to Geospatial databases as they can serve spatial queries [@kulkarni2019cloud]. All OpenLandMap layers available via the data portal are, in principle, immediately made available via our file service, hosted on Wasabi.com.

In this tutorial we explain how to access Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs-COG files, query 
values for COG's at point locations, retrieve the raster data only for a specific 
geographic window (crop images) and run more advanced spatial analysis. We focus mainly 
on the R programming language, although you could also implement the similar 
functionality [using python](https://gitlab.com/geoharmonizer_inea/eumap/-/tree/master/demo/python) or similar.

#### _Listing all layers available_

To list all GeoTIFs available via the OpenLandMap Wasabi service you can use **[this table](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers/-/tree/master/tables/openlandmap_wasabi_files.csv)**. 
The detailed description of all layers is available from [https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers/](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers/).
At the moment, almost all layers that are visible via www.openlandmap.org can also be accessed 
via the OpenLandMap Wasabi service. Note each group of layers that is stored in some 
folder has been resampled to perfectly match the same grid definition (resolution, bounding box etc) 
and can be considered to be a separate **data-cube**.

Currently available groups of layers at `https://s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com/openlandmap/` include:

- layers100m,  
- layers250m,  
- layers1km,  
- layers2km,  
- layers5km,  
- layers10km,  


#### _Viewing data in QGIS_

The public URLs for the COG files can be used to view the files in QGIS or similar ([access GeoTIFFs in QGIS](https://www.cogeo.org/qgis-tutorial.html)). The example below shows FAPAR 
image (annual average for 2014--2017) displayed in QGIS by using the following file location:

```{r}
in.tif = "/vsicurl/https://s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com/openlandmap/predicted1km/pnv_fapar_proba.v.annual_d_1km_s0..0cm_2014..2017_v0.1.tif"
```

Instructions to open the image in QGIS:

- Prepare the URL specifying location of the COG in your geographical region (see above),  
- Open QGIS and select add Raster layer --> HTTP service,  
- Add layers and customize legend / display,  

```{r qgis_layer, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/qgis_openlandmap_add_layer.png")
```

`r fig_nums("qgis_layer", "Opening OpenLandMap layers using QGIS.")`

Once the layers is connected via QGIS, you can use it as virtual layer and compute 
with it as if it was locally stored on your machine. Most importantly, you can use GDAL 
utilities [@mcinerney2014open] to reproject, resample and subset the data. For example, 
to download only FPAR data for Netherlands, and reproject to a local system we use:

```{r}
library(rgdal)
library(terra)
nl.tif = "NL_1km_FAPAR.tif"
nl.te = "12621.63 305583 279621.6 621583"
nl.prj = paste("+proj=sterea +lat_0=52.1561605555556 +lon_0=5.38763888888889 +k=0.9999079", 
          "+x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 +ellps=bessel",
          "+towgs84=565.4171,50.3319,465.5524,-0.398957388243,0.343987817378,-1.87740163998,4.0725",
          "+units=m +no_defs")
system(paste0('gdalwarp ', in.tif, ' ', nl.tif, ' -overwrite ',
              ' -t_srs \"', nl.prj, '\" -te ', nl.te, ' -tr 1000 1000'))
```

```{r nl_plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
nl.sp = rgdal::readGDAL(nl.tif)
spplot(nl.sp)
```

`r fig_nums("nl_plot", "Subset of the FAPAR image for Netherlands.")`

We do **NOT** however recommend computing with complete land mask as this means 
downloading gigabytes of files. Instead, if you need to analyze whole land mask, 
we recommend downloading the files directly from [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=openlandmap).

#### _Point queries_

We can query values in the target layer using WGS84 longitude and latitude coordinates. 
First, we need to connect to the file best using the **terra** package [@hijmans2020package]:

```{r terra}
tif = rast(in.tif)
```

Your R session is now connected with the virtual layer on Wasabi and from here you can use 
all spatial operations normally as the file was available locally:

```{r}
tif
```

Note that the `tif` object is very small. Locally, you have only downloaded the 
file header i.e. geographical definition of the layer including some metadata.

To query a value of the layer at some location xy you can use:

```{r}
xy = data.frame(lon=9.1126, lat=49.6466)
terra::extract(tif, xy)
```

To open this layer in a browser and focus on the location of interest (xy coods) you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
browseURL('https://openlandmap.org/#/?base=BingMaps%20(Aerial)
          &center=49.6466,9.1126&zoom=15&opacity=53&layer=veg_fapar_proba.v.*_d&time=July')
```

This shows the following:

```{r openlandmap_layer, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/openlandmap_preview_fapar.jpg")
```

`r fig_nums("openlandmap_layer", "Viewing FAPAR images using OpenLandMap.")`

To overlay multiple points at the same time, we can use some parallelisation e.g. 
by combining the parallel with terra package:

```{r}
in.tif.lst = paste0("/vsicurl/https://s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com/openlandmap/predicted1km/",
      "pnv_fapar_proba.v.", c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"), 
      "_d_1km_s0..0cm_2014..2017_v0.1.tif")
xy.lst = data.frame(lon=c(4.057, 11.360, 17.911, 10.208, 16.273, -3.799, -1.148, -8.180, 20.833, 16.676),
           lat=c(50.3871, 61.962, 47.252, 46.276, 40.605, 38.335, 52.572, 53.591, 42.077, 51.347))
ov = parallel::mclapply(in.tif.lst, function(i){terra::extract(rast(i), xy.lst)}, mc.cores = 10)
```

which now gives a matrix of values with coordinates and values for target layers:

```{r}
ov.df = as.data.frame(lapply(ov, function(i){i[,2]}))
names(ov.df) = basename(in.tif.lst)
ov.df = cbind(xy.lst, ov.df)
str(ov.df)
```

Note that we do not recommend using more >10 threads to parallelize access as 
the service might block you. If this happens please report your IP and type of error 
you get and we will do our best to help.

#### _Cropping files to smaller areas_

Another useful function in the terra package is the `crop` function which allows us to 
quickly subset and download GeoTIFF, so that we can analyze the data from R:

```{r}
ext <- ext(-5, 5, 5, 10)
rc <- terra::crop(tif, ext)
```

The object size is now small enough for plotting in R:

```{r openlandmap_plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
plot(rc)
```

`r fig_nums("openlandmap_plot", "Example crop of FAPAR image for Western Africa.")`

The same way we could also subset and prepare all layers of interest for this study area. 
So in summary: 

1. OpenLandMap.org provides access to about 1TB of GeoTIFF images (see [complete list](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers/-/tree/master/tables/openlandmap_wasabi_files.csv)).  
2. GeoTIFFs can be all accessed using OpenLandMap.org Wasabi service and then used for spatial analysis.  
3. Please avoid downloading the complete layers / tifs from Wasabi because eventually 
your IP might get blocked.  
4. Instead, to download the complete world coverage, you should use zenodo.org.  

To access OpenLandMap COGs using the terra package you should follow these simple steps:

1. Specify URL location of the layer (global mosaics) based on the **[list](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers/-/tree/master/tables/openlandmap_wasabi_files.csv)**,
2. Define the layer using `tif = rast(in.tif)`.
3. From there you can basically use any terra package operation as if the data was locally on your computer.
4. Do **NOT load or download** the whole global mosaics using COG functionality 
 as this might results in (a) your system crashing, and/or (b) your IP getting blocked.

To read more about GeoTIFF and how to access it using GDAL please refer 
to [this post](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/cog.html). To learn about the terra package, please refer also to the [this manual](https://rspatial.org/terra). Another interesting package for computing with time-series of rasters is the [gdalcubes](https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes_R) package [@appel2019demand].
